# CrowdBand: The Band That Never Was

**A collaborative songwriting game where Reddit communities create original songs together, one lyric at a time.**

CrowdBand transforms Reddit into a virtual recording studio where users collaborate to write songs through weekly creative challenges. Each week presents a thematic prompt, and the community contributes verses, choruses, and bridges that get voted on by the community to create the best collaborative songs.

## What Makes CrowdBand Unique

üéµ **Collaborative Songwriting**: Unlike traditional music games, CrowdBand focuses on creative writing, allowing anyone to contribute meaningful lyrics regardless of musical ability or experience.

‚è∞ **Weekly Creative Challenges**: Each week features a new thematic prompt (starting with "üåô 3 AM Thoughts") that guides the creative direction and keeps the community engaged with fresh inspiration.

üó≥Ô∏è **Democratic Curation**: The community votes on submissions, ensuring the best lyrics rise to the top through collective judgment rather than algorithmic sorting. Users can toggle their votes by clicking again.

üé≠ **Structured Song Sections**: Users can contribute different song parts (verse, chorus, bridge) with distinct visual styling and character limits, creating natural song structure and variety.

üèÜ **One Submission Per Week**: Each user gets one lyric submission per weekly challenge, making every contribution count and encouraging thoughtful creativity.

üì± **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for Reddit's mobile audience with touch-friendly controls and a sleek, music-inspired interface featuring cyberpunk aesthetics with neon gradients and floating animations.

üéº **Song Assembly & Archive**: The game includes functionality to automatically assemble the top-voted lyrics into complete song structures, with an archive system to browse all completed collaborative works.

üìÄ **Dual Interface**: Navigate between the active Studio for current week participation and the Archive to explore the growing collection of community-created songs.

## How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the App**: Click "Enter Studio" from the cyberpunk-styled splash screen featuring floating logo animations, neon waveforms, and the iconic "THE BAND THAT NEVER WAS" title
2. **Start the First Week**: If no challenge is active, click "Start Week 1" to initialize the first creative prompt: "Write a verse about the weird clarity that hits you in the middle of the night" with the theme "üåô 3 AM Thoughts"
3. **Navigate the Interface**: Use the bottom navigation to switch between:
   - üé§ **Studio**: Active songwriting workspace for the current week
   - üìÄ **Archive**: Browse completed songs from previous weeks
4. **Check the Weekly Challenge**: View the current week's creative prompt and theme displayed in the gradient header banner with an info button (‚ìò) for detailed instructions

### Writing and Submitting Lyrics
1. **Craft Your Lyric**: Type your contribution in the dark-themed text area with neon border effects (must be 10-120 characters)
2. **Choose Your Song Section**: Select what type of lyric you're contributing using the gradient-styled buttons:
   - üé§ **Verse**: Storytelling sections that advance the narrative and set scenes (purple styling)
