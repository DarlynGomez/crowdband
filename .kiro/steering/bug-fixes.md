# Kiro Steering: Bug Fixes and Corrections

## Issue 1: Container ID Mismatch (Fixed)
**Problem**: React app showed blank screen
**Root Cause**: index.html had `id="root"` but main.tsx looked for `id="app"`
**Solution**: Changed main.tsx line 6 from `getElementById('app')` to `getElementById('root')`
**Outcome**: App now renders correctly

## Issue 2: TypeScript Config Error (Fixed)
**Problem**: Build failed with "cannot find base config"
**Root Cause**: tsconfig.json tried to extend non-existent `../../tools/tsconfig-base.json`
**Solution**: Replaced with proper client/server tsconfig structure
**Outcome**: Clean builds with proper type checking

## Issue 3: Project Structure Mismatch (Fixed)
**Problem**: Build scripts couldn't find source files
**Root Cause**: Files in root instead of src/client and src/server
**Solution**: Reorganized into proper Devvit Web structure
**Outcome**: Build scripts work correctly

## Issue 4: API Endpoint Pattern (Guided)
**Problem**: Needed to ensure all endpoints start with /api/
**Solution**: Reviewed server code and confirmed proper endpoint patterns
**Outcome**: All endpoints follow Devvit Web requirements

## Issue 5: Scheduled Jobs Implementation (Completed)
**Challenge**: Needed automated weekly song assembly without manual intervention
**Solution**: 
- Added `scheduledJobs` to devvit.json with cron schedule
- Created `/internal/jobs/assemble-weekly-song` endpoint
- Implemented vote-based ranking algorithm
- Added manual moderator trigger as backup
**Kiro Impact**: 
- Spec-driven development ensured proper data flow
- Hook testing validated cron timing
- Automated workflow reduces maintenance to zero
**Outcome**: Fully automated 36-week journey with zero manual intervention needed
